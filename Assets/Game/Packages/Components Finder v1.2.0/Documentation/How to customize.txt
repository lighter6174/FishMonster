How to customize :

You can fully customize this tool to you convenience. 
All the scripts of this tool are accessible, there is no .dll file, no SDK.

You can move the root folder of this tool anywhere you want in your project. 
You can also re-organize the hierarchy inside the tool folders, 
but keep inside the "Editor" folder or his sub-folders the scripts 
that are already inside the "Editor" folder or his sub-folders (else it can bug or prevent you to build your project).

Here's the main things I think you could be interested to customize : 

- Change the shortcut to the 'Components Finder' window :
	In the "ComponentsFinder_Window" script, 
	(path : Components Finder -> Scripts -> Editor -> Window)
	change the string "shortcutName" to your shortcut.

- Change the shortcut to the 'Find Instances In Scene' button :
	In the "SceneInstancesFinder" script, 
	(path : Components Finder -> Scripts -> Editor -> Find Instances In Scene)
	change the string "shortcutName" to your shortcut.

- Change the "Find " string displayed before the component name in the corresponding button :
	In the "ButtonCreator" script,
	(path : Components Finder -> Scripts -> Editor -> Window), 
	remove the "ComponentsFinderStrings.Find_ +" of the gUIText string,

	or

	In the "ComponentsFinderStrings" script,
	(path : Components Finder -> Scripts -> Strings),
	change the "Find" string content to your content.

- Change the Components Finder window minimal Size:
	In the "WindowValues" script, 
	(path : Components Finder -> Scripts -> Editor -> Window)
	change the "MinHeight" value and the "MinLength" value.

- Add your own component cateogries :
	Updates will be normally planned for each Unity components change in future releases 
	(new components, obsolete components removed or changes in the hierarchy of the component menu).

	But if it's not the case, you can still add your own components category.
	You can do it all from scratch but I recommand you to re-use the template scripts in the folder : 
	Components Finder -> Scripts -> Editor -> Create Categories -> Template.
	You need to use one script for the category and one script for each sub category.

	You can duplicate the template scripts and rename them 
	(be sure that the classes has the same name that the scripts name).

	Then call the "CreateCategory ()" method of your script in the "ComponentsFinder_RefreshWindow" script 
	inside the "CreateCategories ()" method. There is already a disabled example for the template scripts you can enable.
